## Non-verbal captioning



### Place Holder for video embedding

### Introduction
Introduction– 1-3 paragraphs: Present the promise/ obstacle/ solution for your project— What is the problem you are solving and why is it important to solve it?

Many users in video meetings rely on captions to participate, such as DHH individuals. For sighted users, research shows user's gaze to be on captions ~80% of time [source](https://www.jstor.org/stable/44393238?seq=1)
These users are unable to experience visual cues, and our project is aimed at enabling visual cues for captions users.

Our solution is to use computer vision to detect visual queues, and present them as a caption for users who rely on captions to participate in meetings.
